I bought this Intel Edison Kit from Yahoo Auctions.
It’s an IoT evaluation board compatible with Arduino.
I added a motor, an LED display, and a handmade cardboard case — together, they allow the device to automatically feed my cat every hour.
Additionally, I built a smartphone app to remotely control it via Wi-Fi.
I probably spent more than I would have on a similar commercial product, but building it myself was way more fun — haha!
